This is my first 'official' script.
I use this in my daily work to quickly find relevant technical publications, for specific questions. 
It's more helpful than the websites and good searching because it displays the information in the way that I need it.
My hope is that this becomes useful for any architects, assessors, and/or engineers, in need of a quick referencing guide. 
Run it from a Jupyter Notebook with the glossary excel saved in the same folder, and you're all good to go.

Feel free to leave a comment if you like the tool or are stuck with how to use it (I've done my best to leave comments in the script.

I'm a novice/amateur coder who does things because I find them fun. Everything I've learned and developed has been through self-learning, and listening to my peers, colleagues, and friends.
This was my first attempt at getting into the field of coding; I find this throughally enjoyable.
